Implement a SnapshotArray that supports pre-defined interfaces (note: see link for more details). 

In a row of dominoes, A[i] and B[i] represent the top and bottom halves of the i-th domino.  (A domino is a tile with two numbers from 1 to 6 - one on each half of the tile.) We may rotate the i-th domino, so that A[i] and B[i] swap values. Return the minimum number of rotations so that all the values in A are the same, or all the values in B are the same. If it cannot be done, return -1.

Your friend is typing his name into a keyboard.  Sometimes, when typing a character c, the key might get long pressed, and the character will be typed 1 or more times. You examine the typed characters of the keyboard.  Return True if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.

### Rotate Digits
We can rotate digits by 180 degrees to form new digits. 
When 0, 1, 6, 8, 9 are rotated 180 degrees, they become 
0, 1, 9, 8, 6 respectively.

 we can move to m[i+1][j], if m[i+1][j] > m[i][j], or 
 can move to m[i][j+1] if m[i][j+1] > m[i][j]. 
 The task is print longest path length if we start from (0, 0).

### Three Sum
Given an array of numbers and a target integer, find three elements from the array that sums up to target. Return the value of these three elements (0-based). (Note: This is different from Two Sum where you had to return the indices)
The triplet of the values returned should be sorted. If multiple such values exist, break ties by returning the triplet with the least first value. If there are still multiple such triplets with same first value, return the triplet with the least second value. If there are still multiple such triplets with same first and second values, return the triplet with the least third value. If there is no triplet that sums to target, return an empty array.

```

### Smallest Supersequences 
Given an array of array of integers arrs and a random permutation p of first n integers {1,2,...,n}. Find if the given permutation p is the smallest supersequence of arrs.
A sequence is said to be a supersequence if it contains all arrays in arrs as subsequences.
A supersequence A is said to be smaller than another supersequence B, if A has less length than B. If both have same length, lexicographically smaller sequence is smaller.
```
Sample 0

### Minimum Jumps
Given an array of non negative numbers, each element in the array reprents maximum jump length from that position. Initially you are at first position (0th index) of the array and you want to go to the last position. Find minimum number of jumps you need to make to reach the last position.
Note that there is always a way to reach the last position.
```
Sample 0
Input
[2,1,3,5,1]
Output
2
Explanation
We can jump 2 steps from index 0 to 2 and then 2 steps from index 2 to 4. So, minimum number of jumps to reach to the last position is 2.
Sample 1
Input
[1,4,2,6,3]
Output
2
```

```

### Best Cover of Array
Given an array A consisting of only 0s and 1s. You can perform the following operation on the array:
choose any contiguous subarray of length at most K and change all the elements of the subarray to 1.
You goal is to find the minimum number of 0s remaining in the array after performing the operation at most Q times.
```
Sample 0
Input
A : [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
K : 2
Q : 2
Output
0

Explanation
We can perform the operation once on the subarray [1, 2],
the array becomes, [1, 1, 0, 1, 1].
Then we perform the operation on the subarray [3, 3],
The array becomes, [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
Sample 1
Input
A : [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
K : 2
Q : 1
Output
1
```
### overlapping intervals 
Given a collection of intervals, find out how many intervals have to be removed to ensure that no interval is overlapping over another. An interval is not considered overlapping if it starts where the previous one ends.
```
For e.g., [0, 1] and [1, 2] are not overlapping intervals while [0, 2] and [1, 2] are. Hereâ€™s an example:

Input: [0, 3], [9, 12], [3, 8], [8, 10]
Answer: 1
In this case, if [8, 10] is removed, there will be no overlapping between the others. Hereâ€™s another example:

Input: [0,5], [1, 2], [3, 5]
Answer: 1
In this case, if [0, 5] is removed, there will be no overlapping between the others.
```


### Shortest Palindrome
Given a string s.

You need to convert the string into a palindrome by appending any characters in front of the given string s.

Return the single string res which is the shortest palindrome after this transformation.

Sample 0
```
Input
s: eedoc

Output
res: codeedoc
```
Sample 1
```
Input
s: aabaaa

Output
res: aaabaaa
```
### Minimizing Largest Sum
You are given an array nums (containing non-negative integers) and an integer m. You can split the original array nums into m non-empty continuous subarrays.

There can be size of nums - 1Cm - 1 total ways to split the array nums into m subarrays.

Consider a function f(way) which accepts a way to split an array nums hence m subarrays will be created, f(way) returns max(sumsubarray_1, sumsubarray_2, ...., sumsubarray_m).

You have to find min(f(way1), f(way2),....., f(waytotal_ways)).

Note: Sum of all elements of array nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

Sample 0
```
Input
nums: [5, 6]
m: 1

Output
11

Explanation
As the array can be splitted in only 1 array then it will be the original array nums only contaning sum 11.
```
Sample 1
```
Input
nums: [7, 9, 9]
m: 2

Output
16

Explanation
The array nums can be splitted in 2 subarrays in following ways:

[7], [9,9]
[7, 9], [9]

The first split have sums of subarrays (7, 18), so max(7, 18) = 18.
The second split have sums of subarrays (16, 9), so max(16, 9) = 16
Our final answer is min(18, 16) = 16.
```

### Coins in the Path
There is a stone-path in Mario land. Mario will always start from the first stone and he wants to reach last stone with minimum cost.
Each stone has a cost to jump on it given in the array. Mario has jump ability represented by steps i.e he can jump to any stone in range [ i + 1, i + steps ] when standing on stone at i'th-index.

Given an integer array array of length N and an integer steps where,

N = Number of stones
array[i] = Cost to jump on ith-stone
steps = Mario's jump ability

Note: if array[i] == -1 then Mario can't jump on that stone.

Return the path of indexes (0-based indexing) with the smallest cost. If there are multiple paths with the smallest cost, then return lexicographically smallest one.
If no possible path is found then return an empty array.
```
Sample 0
Input
array: [1, 3, 2, -1, 1]
steps: 2

Output
[0, 2, 4]

Explanation
There is only one minimum cost path possible starting from index-0 is 0, 2, 4 with cost 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

Sample 1
Input
array: [2, 3, 5, 3, 1]
steps: 3

Output
[0, 1, 4]

Explanation
There are two paths possible 0, 1, 4 and 0, 3, 4 with same cost 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.So lexicographically smaller path is our answer i.e 0, 1, 4.
```

You are given an array arr and integer d. Find longest non-decreasing subsequence of arr such that the difference between consecutive elements of the sequence is less than d.
Value of d is small.
Note - A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
```
Sample 0
Input
arr: [1]
d: 1

Output
1

Explanation
Array only has a single sequence satisfying this property.

Sample 1
Input
arr: [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]
